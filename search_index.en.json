I am Stefano Fiorucci.\nI’ve always been passionate about coding since childhood. After studying 🏗️ Civil Engineering, I switched to Machine Learning.\n🏄🏻‍♂️ In my career so far, I’ve navigated between Software Engineering, Information Retrieval, and Natural Language Processing. These days, my main focus is on Language Models: training (SFT, GRPO…), orchestration (RAG, Agents, …), syntethic data.\n🤝 I care deeply about open source and enjoy contributing, whether through code or by training Small Language Models. Similarly, sharing what I learn and build over time feels natural to me: I like creating tutorials and demos, sharing things on social media, and occasionally giving talks…\n👨‍💻 Currently, I work at deepset, contributing to Haystack, an open-source LLM framework.\nMy key contributions include unified Tool support (foundational for Agents), image capabilities, faster imports, and CI speed-ups. I also curate Haystack’s integration ecosystem: Hugging Face, FastEmbed, Ollama, pgvector, Pinecone, Qdrant, Unstructured, and more. I love collaborating with the DevRel team to create tutorials and recipes that showcase practical use cases and help users.\nIn my spare time, I love taking meditative walks 🚶, dedicating myself to social volunteering ⭐, and exploring creativity through theater, music, books, and movies 🎨.\nTo know more about my professional experience, check out my LinkedIn.\nCurious about what I build?

It scales logits before softmax, altering the sharpness of the output distribution:\nHigher temperatures produce a more uniform, random output.\nLower temperature creates a sharper distribution, approaching greedy search predictability.\nTop-K and Top-p sampling are also popular.\n🍪 Patrick von Platen wrote a classic practical guide on decoding strategies.\n🌀 The future of sampling: Entropy is all you need?\nRecent projects and papers, like “Softmax is Not Enough”, “Min-p Sampling”, and entropix, explore fresh approaches to sampling during inference.\nThe common idea is to adjust token selection techniques/parameters during inference. For example, temperature can be dynamically adapted during generation.\n“Softmax is not enough” and entropix explore using entropy as a measure of model uncertainty. High entropy means more uncertainty (a wider range of viable token choices), while low entropy suggests confidence in a smaller set.\nThis measure can guide generation tuning.\nIt’s a vast and fascinating landscape.\n🍪 For an intro to these recent techniques, check out the great slide deck by Pierre-Carl Langlais.","description":"An intro to classic and modern decoding/sampling strategies for LLMs","id":"https://anakin87.github.io/blog/decoding-strategies/","path":"/blog/decoding-strategies/","title":"🔮 Decoding strategies and the future of Language Models"},"https://anakin87.github.io/blog/dpo-onpolicy/":{"body":"TIP\n👨‍💻 You can find the code on this Kaggle notebook.\nFor a short intro, read on!\nIntro to DPO\nPreference tuning is a common step in fine-tuning Language Models,\nwhere the model learns to favor desirable responses over less helpful ones.\nA popular approach for this is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).\nIt trains models on examples like:\nPrompt; chosen response; rejected response\nCompared to other Preference Tuning methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (e.g. PPO),\nDPO has several advantages:\n✅ Simplicity\n✅ Stability\n✅ Memory efficiency\nDPO is popular among practitioners, and not only: even Llama-3 was trained with DPO.\nDPO limitations\n❌ Research has shown that DPO often falls short of PPO in terms of model performance (see Is DPO Superior to PPO for LLM Alignment?

Maxime Labonne has released several impressive models and contributed to popularize this paradigm.\nEvolutionary Model Merging\nDespite this success, choosing the models to merge, the techniques and their parameters is a form of black art, relying on intuition and trial and error. 🔮\nTo fix this, Sakana AI introduced 🧬 Evolutionary Model Merge, a general method using evolutionary algorithms to discover optimal ways to combine open models.\nEvolutionary Algorithms are black-box optimization algorithms operating on a population of potential solutions by evolving them through generations with operators such as selection, mutation, recombination, and crossover. The fitness function is crucial, as it evaluates the quality of each solution, guiding the selection process by favoring higher-scoring solutions for reproduction.\nAmong the models Sakana AI released to demonstrate this technique is EvoLLM-JP, an LLM with Japanese and math capabilities, resulting from merging multiple models.\n💸 Evolutionary Model Merging has one major problem: repeatedly evaluating the fitness function on candidate models is expensive. It requires these models to generate completions on a held-out validation set.\nReproducing EvoLLM-JP’s evolutionary merging with an NVIDIA 4090 (24GB VRAM) would take 2 months 🤯\nMERGE3 and Mergenetic: evolutionary model merging for all\n🪄 The researchers of GLADIA first invented a technique called MERGE3 that extracts a reduced dataset for evaluation, estimates model abilities using Item Response Theory (IRT), and evolves optimal merges via IRT-based performance estimators.\nMERGE3 achieves similar results to EvoLLM-JP, while reducing fitness computation costs 50×.\nEvolving such a model can require hours instead of months!\nGLADIA researchers are now releasing 🧪 Mergenetic, a library for Evolutionary Model Merging\n⭐ User friendly and research oriented\n⭐ Rich in merging techniques and evolutionary algorithms\n⭐ Multi-objective optimization\n⭐ Accelerated evolution through subsampling and approximation (with techniques like MERGE3)\n⭐ integrates with LM Eval Harness and supports custom fitness functions\n⭐ offers a Python API, a CLI and a GUI\nI recommend giving it a try to evolve your models affordably.\n👥 Authors: Adrian Robert Minut, Tommaso Mencattini, Andrea Santilli, Donato Crisostomi, Emanuele Rodolà\n📚 Resources\nMergenetic library\nMergenetic paper\nMERGE3 paper\nSakana AI - Evolutionary Model Merging\nPaper\nBlog post","description":"Intro to a recent libray/papers on evolutionary model merging","id":"https://anakin87.github.io/blog/mergenetic/","path":"/blog/mergenetic/","title":"🧪 Mergenetic: evolutionary model merging for all"},"https://anakin87.github.io/blog/minerva/":{"body":"I had the pleasure of joining Luca Corbucci in a special interview.\nWith Simone Conia we explored Minerva, a family of LLM trained from scratch on the Italian language by Sapienza NLP researchers.\n🎙️ Pointer Podcast episode - in Italian 🎙️\nIf you are passionate about language models, this interview is not to be missed:\nHow to train a Language Model\nThe selection of data and the creation of a specific tokenizer\nPre-training\nPhases of fine-tuning and Online Direct Preference Optimization\nModel evaluation\nEthical aspects and environmental impact\nThe future of Minerva.\nThank you for the opportunity!","description":"Interview with Simone Conia, one of the creators of Minerva, LLM trained from scratch in Italian.","id":"https://anakin87.github.io/blog/minerva/","path":"/blog/minerva/","title":"Minerva: the Italian LLM 🧠🇮🇹"},"https://anakin87.github.io/blog/model-merging/":{"body":"Merging LLMs is a recent trend in the AI community, with merged models taking the top ranks in Language Models leaderboards.\nUsing mergekit, merging LLMs is easy and you don’t even need a GPU!\nBut how does it work?\nWhy merging models?\nTraditionally, models are fine-tuned to acquire new capabilities - a process demanding time and resources.\nModel merging allows combining the capabilities of two (or more) existing models, without fine-tuning.\nIt is possible, for example, to combine two 7B models (one good at conversation 💬, the other good at math 🧮) to make a single 7B model with similar abilities to the original models.\n⚙️ What happens under the hood?\nWe often think of a Generative Language Model as a text-generation machine.\nWe can also see it as a neural network: a matrix of weights (scalars) + activation functions.\nModel merging manipulates these weights mathematically/geometrically without training.\n🛠️ Techniques\nThe simplest approach involves merging models by computing a weighted average of their weights -&gt; Model soups 🥣\nSLERP (Spherical Linear Interpolation) is a more advanced interpolation method that ensures better preservation of distinct characteristics from the original models.\nThis method is very popular and has been used to create SOTA merged models!\nThe “Editing Models with Task Arithmetic” paper introduced the concept of “task vector”: the vector associated with a specific task/capability.\nIt is obtained by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained model from the weights of the same model after fine-tuning.\nBy manipulating these task vectors through addition or subtraction, more targeted model merges become feasible.\nRecent techniques like TIES and DARE build upon the Task Arithmetic framework, enabling the merging of a larger number of models while retaining their strengths.\n🔮 Looking ahead\nMerging LLMs seems promising, allowing the production of good models quickly and inexpensively.\nCharles Goddard, the creator of mergekit, has recently joined Arcee AI (quite active in the area of Small Language Models) and I expect progress in this field…\n📚 Resources\nCheck out these great blog posts:\nMerge Large Language Models with mergekit by Maxime Labonne\nMerge Large Language Models by Sergei Savvov\nAlso Omar Sanseviero recently experimented with these techniques.\n🧪 Recap\n📖 Collection of papers","description":"","id":"https://anakin87.github.io/blog/model-merging/","path":"/blog/model-merging/","title":"🧩🧩 Merging Language Models: what I've learned"},"https://anakin87.github.io/blog/multilingual-magpie/":{"body":"TIP\nOk, you’re finally convinced that synthetic data works… ⚗️\nNow you want to generate an instruction dataset in a language other than English.\nBut how do you get started?\nI explore how to do this with Magpie in my new tutorial.\nFor a short intro, read on!\n🐦‍⬛ What is Magpie?\nIt’s a recent technique for creating synthetic instruction datasets.\nMagpie is based on a simple but ingenious idea 👇\nIf you prompt an instruction-tuned model with a pre-query template, you can make it generate a plausible user instruction.\nHere’s an example:\nmodel: Llama-3-8B-Instruct\npre-query template: &lt;|begin_of_text|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;user&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;\ngenerated user instruction: “What are some of the responsibilities of a commercial pilot?”\nYou can then feed this instruction back into the same model to get the assistant response.\nBy repeating this process, it’s possible to generate large synthetic datasets with relatively little effort.\n🪄 The authors demonstrate that using these datasets for Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) can yield strong performance, even competitive with the original instruct model.\n🧗 Generating non-English data\nMost Language Models are primarily trained on English texts, so they tend to produce data in English.\nHow can we overcome this?\nEarlier approaches were complex or costly.\nThen Manuel Romero found a simple solution: add the target language to the pre-query template.\nFor Spanish, the template becomes &lt;|begin_of_text|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;user&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;spanish:.\nThis method works for Spanish and German!\n❌ Unfortunately, it does not work well for other languages (🇮🇹, 🇳🇱, …)\n💡 Magpie with system message\nI had another idea: use the system message to steer generation towards a specific language.\nThe system message should be in the target language, like:\n“You are an artificial intelligence that answers users’ questions in TARGET_LANGUAGE in a useful and detailed way.

it imparts it the ability to do reasoning, even if it isn’t necessarily always correct.\nFurther SFT is useful, but the data curation is expensive, when compared to marginal improvements gains.\nPreference finetuning on the other has a weaker per-sample reward signal, which is why many models resort to large-scale RL tuning. However, starting from an SFT checkpoint improves RL sample efficiency, by using the (weaker) reward signal to improve on the reasoning accuracy rather than the style, since it doesn’t have to stray too far from the response model distribution and incur a KL penalty.","description":"","id":"https://anakin87.github.io/blog/sft-vs-pa/","path":"/blog/sft-vs-pa/","title":"Supervised Fine-Tuning vs Preference Alignment: Who does what in Post-Training?"},"https://anakin87.github.io/blog/spectrum/":{"body":"TIP\nI’ve published an extensive tutorial on Spectrum on the 🤗 Hugging Face blog.\nFor a short intro, read on!\nQLoRA\nQLoRA revolutionized LLM fine-tuning in May 2023.\nThis method trains Low Rank Adapters on top of a quantized Language Model, drastically reducing GPU memory usage.\nQLoRA made fine-tuning accessible on consumer hardware and became incredibly popular.\nHowever, QLoRA has some limitations ⛔\nLower performance compared to full fine-tuning.\nHighly sensitive to hyperparameters (rank and alpha).\nLoRA-trained models introduce “intruder” dimensions, potentially misaligning them with pre-training distribution and limiting adaptability to new tasks (see LoRA vs Full Fine-tuning: An Illusion of Equivalence).\nLooking for simplicity, full performance, and memory savings?\nSpectrum\n🎯 Spectrum is an interesting alternative.\n🔬 Analyzes weight matrices for all layers in a Language Model and calculates a Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) for each one.\n🔹 Uses Random Matrix Theory (Marchenko-Pastur distribution) to distinguish signal from noise.\n🔹 Based on a chosen percentage (say, 25%), Spectrum selects the most informative layers of each type (e.g., mlp.down_proj, self_attn.o_proj, etc.).\n🔹 You can then ❄️ freeze the entire model except for these selected layers 🔥 and focus your fine-tuning on them.\nSpectrum: evaluation and results\nIn the paper, the authors fine-tuned Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B-v0.1 on the airoboros-3.1 dataset using Spectrum-50 and Spectrum-25, comparing results with full fine-tuning and QLoRA.\n📊 Spectrum is competitive with full fine-tuning and outperforms QLoRA on benchmark performance.\n⚡ More memory-efficient than QLoRA in distributed training.
