I like playing with small language models and applying them to practical problems.

Recently, I turned one of these experiments into a step-by-step recipe for the Open-Source AI cookbook (by 🤗 Hugging Face)!

🎯 Goal: automatically extract structured information from startup funding announcements found on the web.

In this notebook, you'll discover how to:
- 🏗️ Build an Information Extraction pipeline orchestrated by Haystack
- 🧠 Use [NuExtract](https://huggingface.co/numind/NuExtract), a powerful Small Language Model (3.8B) fine-tuned for data extraction (by NuMind)
- 🗒️ Visualize results with Pandas
- 🕵️ Create a simple graph to derive insights, such as the relationships between companies and investors
