When you start building with Language Models, it's likely you'll play around with various prompts before achieving your goal.

Soon, you realize you need:
- Templating to include dynamic elements in your prompts.
- Versioning and storing prompts - to avoid losing the results of your experiments.

That's where [*Banks*](https://github.com/masci/banks) comes in.

My friend Massimiliano Pippi developed this lightweight Python library based on Jinja2.

It's named after Louise Banks, the character portrayed by Amy Adams in Arrival, who is enlisted by the United States Army to communicate with extraterrestrials.

Banks focuses on:
- 📙 Templating for text and chat messages
- 🎟️ Prompt Versioning
- 🗄️ Prompt Management

Once you start exploring it, you'll discover several bonus 𝐟𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬:
- ✨ LM-assisted prompt creation
- 🔧 tool calling directly from the prompt
- 💾 prompt caching
- 🚅 LiteLLM (YC W23) support
- 〰️ Async support


⭐⭐ Give [Banks](https://github.com/masci/banks) a star! ⭐⭐
